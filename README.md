# My emacs config

This is my emacs configuration files. If you want to use them, the
best thing is probably to fork the project at Github
(<http://github.com/marcwebbie/emacs>) and then make your changes to that
branch. This config is based on
[rejeep's](https://github.com/rejeep/emacs) and [magnar's](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d) configs.

## Installing emacs

First of all make sure you have installed Emacs version 24 or higher.

### OSX

I use Cocoa Emacs, installed like this:

    brew install emacs --cocoa --srgb

### Ubuntu [source](http://askubuntu.com/questions/297170)

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs
    sudo apt-get update

For emacs-snapshot:

    sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot-el emacs-snapshot-gtk emacs-snapshot

Or, for emacs24 (i.e. 24.3, stable):

    sudo apt-get install emacs24 emacs24-el emacs24-common-non-dfsg

### Compile emacs 24 from source on Red Hat 6

    curl -fsSkl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcwebbie/emacs/master/scripts/compile_emacs24_rh6.sh | sh

### Fetch the config files:

    git clone git://github.com/marcwebbie/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d

### Install all ELPA packages (make sure you have [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) installed):

    ~/.emacs.d/scripts/install.sh

- or -

    cd ~/.emacs.d
    cask

## Tips for using these emacs settings

If you want to use my settings straight out of the box, here are some things to note:

 * I recommend starting with a blank emacs +
   [Technomancy's better-defaults package](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults),
   and then dig through this repo for useful nuggets, instead of forking it directly.

 * Start by reading up on all the cool stuff in key-bindings.el.

 * Autocomplete with `C-.` (autocomplete entire lines with `C-:`)

 * On a mac, the Meta key `M` is bound to Command.

 * I recommend rebinding Caps Lock to Ctrl and use that instead of the often badly placed Ctrl-key.

 * Watch [emacsrocks.com](http://emacsrocks.com)

## Optional env setup

### Using Xdefaults for setting fonts in linux

    cp ~/.emacs.d/.Xdefaults ~/.Xdefaults
    xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults

### Setting emacs to run in daemon mode

    # OSX
    alias es='/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs --daemon'
    alias emacs='/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -c -n $*'
    export EDITOR='/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -c'
