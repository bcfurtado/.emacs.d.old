# marcwebbie emacs configuration

This is my emacs configuration files. If you want to use them, the
best thing is probably to fork the project at Github
(<http://github.com/marcwebbie/emacs>) and then make your changes to that
branch.

## Installation

First of all make sure you have installed Emacs version 24.1 or higher.

Fetch the emacs source files:

    $ git clone git://github.com/marcwebbie/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d

Install all ELPA packages (make sure you have
[Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) installed):

    $ cd ~/.emacs.d
    $ cask
